The quiz begins once the user clicks on the "Start Quiz" button. Questions are displayed one at a time once the user selects an answer. A response to the selection is shown telling the user if they chose the correct answer. The quiz has a time/score limit of 75 seconds. The timer decreases upon the click of the "Start Quiz" button. It will also decrease by 10 seconds if the answer is incorrect. The quiz ends once the user has finished answering all questions or time is up. The user then has a chance to record his or her score at the end by an input of the appropriate initials. Values are stored for viewing by clicking "View Highscores". An alert box pops up in the window to show.
